# Analyst-Analysis
What if you traded stocks solely on analyst recommendations? Neat project to determine whether or not analysts are worth listening to. Enter in any stock and any # of years and it will back-trade and compare the results to traditional buying and holding.

For the logic behind the program, we attempt to buy or sell a given stock based on the average analyst rating for the day. Buying and selling accounts for some slippage buy buying at the end of the day or at the start of the next day, depending on when the recommendation was released.

Here are some example results of running the program (taken on 7/24/21).

(***NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE***)                                         
Trading off of analyst recommendations is surprisingly acceptable. When the stock rallies, analysts tend to lag behind in terms of gains. When the stock tanks, like with CLX, analysts manage to save some cash as opposed to buying and holding. To me, trading off of analyst recommendations seems akin to trusting my money with some investment fund. I might not actively be making the decisions, but my money is being managed by someone else with a decent reputation for this kind of stuff.
